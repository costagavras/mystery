CHOICES

First Choice: 1. Stick with the PB&J your mom packed you. You're really looking forward to those Hip Tunes..
Second Choice: 1. Get to work helping. Take a look around the room. Look for people and things that look suspicious or stand out. The sooner begun, the sooner done.

Third Choice: 3. Approach Danny
Fourth Choice: 4. You've seen enough. Danny's clearly guilty! Taking out the trash? Cleaning up the mess? Come on. Accuse Danny.
Fifth Choice: 1. Approach Helga and the Doctor
Sixth Choice: 2. Talk to them directly
Seventh Choice: 1. Wait a minute. Helga should've known not to pick up the pipe. Everyone knows not to touch evidence at a crime scene. UNLESS... she was purposely trying to contaminate the pipe so that you wouldn't be able to lift her prints from it. Accuse her.
